# Creating Primitive Types Variables in Your Programs

### Primitive Types

The Java programming language is statically-typed, which means that all variables must first be declared before they can be used.

```java
int gear = 1;
```

Doing so tells your program that a fields named `gear` exists, hold numerical data, and has a  initial value of `1`.
